            <p>Centuries ago extraction of food, high in energy & calorific value was need of the time to tackle problems of food scarcity. During last few decades we overcome the problem by better farming methods along with new food processing & preservation techniques. Today High calories and processed food has become integral part of modern lifestyle. Modern food habits and fast food products offers us imbalanced high calorie low nutritional food intake resulting into lifestyle diseases like obesity diabetics & hypertension. Child obesity is one of the serious problems for many countries. <br /> <br />
            
            Traditionally Sugarcane is known as a source of high calorie sugar. But what we want to tell the world is that it can be a source of effective dietary fiber also. Sugarcane is one of the efficient photo synthesizer (can produce max. amount of biomass per unit area) crop in the world. It also contains many vital vitamin & minerals. Sugarcane has a capacity to provide assured and economical source of dietary fiber supplement. <br /> <br />
            
            Best available source of raw material combined with our innovative technology has a potential to offer best option for dietary fiber supplement to the world of nutrition. Our technology respects nature. We do not use any harmful chemicals in the process and we do not alter cell structure of plant material</p>

        <p>Raditionally Sugarcane is known as a source of high calorie sugar. We have invented sugarcane processing technology that converts whole sugarcane plant into edible dietary fiber. Our innovation proves that it can also be a rich & effective source of dietary fiber. <br /> Modification in traditional cane processing technology with addition of our innovative methods produces fine sugarcane flour which is neutral in taste & odor. This sugarcane flour is rich & effective dietary fiber which can be added as dietary fiber additive to many food products. Process is designed to retain all vital vitamins & minerals available in sugarcane in the final product.</p>
